        <H1>Big Dream</H1>
        <h2>Become Worlds Number One Developer</h2>
        <p>As a young child, my dream occupation was to dig up dinosaurs. As I grew older and my interests changed, my dream profession changed also. Although most of these dreams were not very long lived, one occupational dream has outlasted all others, and has finally emerged as the dream I passionately pursue.



                It all started when my grandparents purchased their first computer. Being as this was the first computer I had ever used, I did not know how to use it very well. I mostly used it for games, which my grandma would set up for me to play. I also drew pictures with the computer's paint program, the functionality of which, unfortunately, was very limited. The relatively new computer industry's technology could not produce enough colors to portray very realistic pictures. Despite this fact, I spent many contented hours creating images on my grandparent's computer.</p>
